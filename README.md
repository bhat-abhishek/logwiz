# LogWiz


**LogWiz** is a lightweight, flexible, and powerful logging library for frontend applications. Inspired by the simplicity and extensibility of Winston, LogWiz provides an easy-to-use API for logging messages with various levels of severity. Designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript applications, LogWiz can be seamlessly integrated into any frontend project.

## Features

- **Multiple Log Levels**: Support for `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `debug` log levels.
- **Customizable Transports**: Log to the console, external services like AWS CloudWatch, or any custom transport you define.
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript support with type definitions.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal footprint, ideal for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed and open for contributions.

## Installation

Install LogWiz via npm:

```bash
npm install logwiz
```

## Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you up and running with LogWiz:

### TypeScript

```typescript
import { Logger, logwiz } from 'logwiz';

const loggerOptions: logwiz.LoggerOptions = {
  level: "info",
  transports: ["console", "cloudwatch"],
};

const logger = new Logger(loggerOptions);

logger.info("This is an info message");
logger.warn("This is a warning message");
logger.error("This is an error message");
logger.debug("This is a debug message");
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
const { Logger } = require('logwiz');

const loggerOptions = {
  level: "info",
  transports: ["console", "cloudwatch"],
};

const logger = new Logger(loggerOptions);

logger.info("This is an info message");
logger.warn("This is a warning message");
logger.error("This is an error message");
logger.debug("This is a debug message");
```

## API Reference

### LoggerOptions

```typescript
interface LoggerOptions {
  level: "info" | "warn" | "error" | "debug";
  transports: ("console" | "cloudwatch")[];
}
```

- \`level\`: The minimum level of logs that should be processed.
- \`transports\`: An array of transports where the logs should be sent.

### Logger

The core class for logging. Provides methods for logging at different levels.

#### Methods

- log(level: string, message: string, meta?: any): void
- info(message: string, meta?: any): void
- warn(message: string, meta?: any): void
- error(message: string, meta?: any): void
- debug(message: string, meta?: any): void

## Custom Transports

LogWiz allows you to define custom transports for logging. Here's a simple example of creating a custom transport:

```typescript
class CustomTransport {
  log(level: string, message: string, meta?: any): void {
    // Custom logic to handle log messages
  }
}

const customTransport = new CustomTransport();
```

## Runbook

### Install

```bash
# Using yarn (recommended)
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install
```

### Build

Compiles TypeScript sources in `src/` to JavaScript in `dist/`:

```bash
yarn build
# or
npm run build
```

### Test

No test runner is configured yet. To add one:

```bash
# Example: add Jest with ts-jest
yarn add --dev jest ts-jest @types/jest
# Then add a "test" script to package.json and create __tests__/ files
```

### Publish (npm)

```bash
yarn build            # ensure dist/ is up to date
npm publish           # publishes the dist/ directory per package.json "files"
```
